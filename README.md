# CricStrategizer üöÄüèè

## Overview

Cricket, the second most popular sport globally with 2.5 billion fans, is witnessing continuous growth in popularity. The Indian Premier League (IPL), valued at 5.3 billion in 2017, showcases the sport's immense appeal. Viacom18 secured IPL digital rights for 3.0 billion, while Disney Star retained TV rights for 3.05 billion for 2023-27. With 60+ national teams and professional players, cricket is a dynamic and exciting sport with a worldwide fan base actively playing and investing their time.

## Project Objective

CricStrategizer is designed to revolutionize cricket strategy by predicting a batsman's shot outcome for a particular delivery based on specific properties. By leveraging machine learning models developed on IPL 2022 data, the project aims to empower players and teams to strategically analyze and understand a batsman's playing style, facilitating effective game plans and strategies.
